# PHP Deprecated mysql_* Functions

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP code: the use of deprecated `mysql_*` functions.  These functions are no longer supported and have been removed from PHP 7.0 and later.  Using them will result in errors.

The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.php` file provides a solution using MySQLi.

This example highlights the importance of keeping your PHP code up-to-date and using modern, supported functions.
